## Project Description

<ul>
  <li>In the world, especially in India, river water is the main source of all anthropogenic activities such as drinking water, irrigation and agriculture. Farmers use fertilizers and pesticides to improve crop growth. However, these fertilizers and pesticides can be washed out of the soil by rain and eventually washed into rivers. The river water quality is getting degraded day by day. The concentration of nitrates and phosphates in water rises significantly when large amounts of fertilizer and agricultural wastes enter rivers.</li>
  <li>Algae use these substances to grow and multiply rapidly, turning the water green. This algae overgrowth, called eutrophication, leads to pollution. When algae die, they are decomposed by the action of bacteria, which grow rapidly and use up the oxygen in the water, leads to an affect in marine life.</li>
  <li>This project consists of both Web and Mobile application, where the Authorities can monitor the data of the river at real-time. Both applications give the Authorities the option to monitor the parameters of the river water and then control the motor remotely.</li>
  <li>Here technologies like Python 3.7 with ibmiotf module, IBM Watson Platform, Node-red to achieve the results. Primary parameters like pH, DO, Temperature, Turbidity, Ammonia & Nitrate are monitored and some secondary parameters like TSS, Zinc, Chloride, Conductivity are displayed in the secondary tab.</li>
  <li>The authorities have separate tab to control the motors, which is automatically switched when the parameters are abnormal. They have the remote access of the motor to filter, with the help of the IoT technologies.</li>
</ul>
